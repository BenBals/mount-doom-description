% \paragraph*{Vertex Cover Solvers}
%Initially, we reduce the instance using the kernelization procedure, implemented by the winning solver of the 2019 PACE challenge \cite{Hespe2020WeGotYouCoveredTW}.
%When solving the vertex cover problem heuristically, we now use a local-search solver~\cite{Cai2013NuMVCAE} on this kernel.
%To solve the kernel exactly, we use a branch-and-reduce solver~\cite{pg21satreduce}, which we augment by implementing better upper bounds using the aforementioned local-search solver.
