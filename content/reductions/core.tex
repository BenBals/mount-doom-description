\textbf{Improved CORE.} A vertex $a$ is a core of a diclique if the graph induced by $a$ and its neighbors is a diclique. Traditionally, one now deletes $N(a)$ from $G$ since if $S'$ is optimal for $G - N(v)$ then $S' \cup N(v)$ is optimal for $G$~\cite{lemaic2008markov}. We proceed differently and shortcut the node $a$ if $N^+(a)$ or $N^-(a)$ are dicliques. While this extension is easy to prove, it is, to the best of our knowledge, novel.
