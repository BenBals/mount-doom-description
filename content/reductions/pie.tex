\textbf{PIE.} Recall that $\text{PIE}$ is the set of bidirectional edges. Now consider any edge $uv$ between different strongly connected components in $G - \text{PIE}$. Any cycle using this edge must therefore use at least one bidirectional edge, which must be covered anyways, so we can safely delete $uv$.
