\textbf{SHORTONE.} Consider any node $v$ which has exactly one incoming edge $uv$ and one outgoing edge $vw$ in $G - PIE$ such that any bidirectional neighbor of $v$  is also a bidirectional neighbor of at least one out of $u$ or $w$. In that case we remove the edges $uv$ and $vw$ and add $uw$. Call the reduced graph $G'$. For correctness, take any solution $S$ in $G$. If $v \not \in S$, then $S$ is also a solution for $G'$. If $v \in S$, assume $S$ is not a solution in $G'$. Then $u,w \not \in S$ since any cycle introduced by the reduction must use $uw$. Since all bidirectional neighbors of $v$ are also bidirectional neighbors of $u$ or $w$, those must all be in $S$. Thus we can simply replace $v$ by $u$ (or $w$) and obtain a solution of the same size. Also, any solution in $G'$ is always a solution in $G$.
