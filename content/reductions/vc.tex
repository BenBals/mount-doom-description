\subsection{Vertex Cover Reductions.}
Note that if we have a bidirectional edge between $a$ and $b$, we have to take at least one of $a$ and $b$ into the DFVS. Therefore we can regard $G[PIE]$ as a vertex cover subproblem. Any DFVS for $G$ must necessarily be a vertex cover for that subgraph. For that reason some vertex cover reduction rules~\cite{Fomin2009MeasureAndConquer} translate well to DFVS.
