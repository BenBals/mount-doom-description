\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:prelims}

Let $G = (V,E)$ be a directed graph.
The Directed Feedback Vertex Set problem asks to find a minimum $S\subseteq V$, such that $G - S$ is acyclic.

Let $v,w  \in V$.
We define $N^+(v)$ as the outgoing neighbors of $v$ and $N^-(v)$ as the incoming neighbors.
We call an edge $vw \in E$ bidirectional if $wv \in E$ as well.
Let $\text{PIE}\subseteq E$ be the set of all bidirectional edges and let $B\subseteq V$ be the set of all vertices only incident to bidirectional edges.
We define the bidirectional neighbors $N(v)$ as those which are incident using bidirectional edges.
Additionally, we call $D\subseteq V$ a diclique, if all $u \in D$ have $D \setminus \{u\} \subseteq N(u)$.

Finally, let $v\in V$ be given.
Let $V' = V \setminus \{v\}$ and $E' = (E \cap (V' \times V')) \cup (N^-(v) \times N^+(v))$.
We call  $G'= (V', E')$ the graph obtained from $G$ by short cutting $v$.
In light of the DFVS, this is equivalent to adding the assumption $v \notin S$.
