\section{Reduction rules}\label{sec:reductions}
We apply a number of reductions known from the literature and introduce one rule which to the best of our knowledge is new.
The known rules can be found in \cite{lemaic2008markov} and we adopt their nomenclature.
Additionally, we adapt some reduction rules, that have already been used for the Vertex Cover problem.
Before running the reduction rules, all nodes with self loops are collected into the solution and removed from the graph.
Isolated nodes are removed as well.
