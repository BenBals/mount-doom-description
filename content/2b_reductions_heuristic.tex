\section{Reduction rules}\label{sec:reductions}
We apply two reduction rules known from literature.
These rules can be found in \cite{lemaic2008markov} and we adopt their nomenclature.

\input{content/reductions/pie}
%\paragraph*{PIE} Recall that $\text{PIE}$ is the set of bidirectional edges. Now consider any edge $uv$ between different strongly connected components in $G - \text{PIE}$. Any cycle using this edge must therefore use at least one bidirectional edge, which must be covered anyways, so we can safely delete $uv$.
