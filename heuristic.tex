\begin{abstract}
This document describes the techniques we used and implemented for our submission the Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge (PACE) 2022. The given problem is \emph{Directed Feedback Vertex Set} (DFVS), where you are given a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ and want to find a minimum $S\subseteq V$ such that $G-S$ is acyclic.
Our approach first generates an initial greedy solution. This solution is then checked for minimality under exclusion of a single node and exchange of two solution nodes for one new node.
