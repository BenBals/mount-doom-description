\begin{abstract}
In this document we describe the techniques we used and implemented for our submission to the Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge (PACE) 2022. The given problem is \emph{Directed Feedback Vertex Set} (DFVS), where you are given a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ and want to find a minimum $S\subseteq V$ such that $G-S$ is acyclic.
We approach this problem by first exhaustively applying a set of reduction rules. 
In order to find a minimum DFVS on this remaining instance, we create and solve a series of Vertex Cover instances.
